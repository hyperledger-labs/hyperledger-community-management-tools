# Hyperledger Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger projects, we'd love to hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the impact and credit the discoverer.

Open a GitHub security vulnerability report: Open a draft security advisory on the “Security” tab of this GitHub repository. See GitHub Security Advisories to learn more about the security infrastructure in GitHub.
